# AndroidMinSUApplication
AND1 project 4th semester
Brief description of the application and the motivation behind it:

The applicationâ€™s a calculator to help international students in Denmark to keep track of the hours worked required to receive SU.

The SU office requirements for EU students are to work a minimum between 10-12 hours a week, and there is a maximum limit of income that must be respected, otherwise you should pay back your allowance.

It is not easy to calculate monthly hours because some payslips go from the 15th to the 14th of the month. Moreover, if you don't always work the same days of the week, some days can go to the previous or the following month. That's why it is essential that on a three-month average, the hours per month are a minimum of around 43.

Most international students develop complicated excel sheets to keep track of the hours, the salaries, the holiday pay, the bonuses, etc.

This app aims to help with all these calculations, to warn students when the hours are not reached or when they are working too much.

There is a simple calculator on the website of minSU, but it is really complicated to operate, and it requires some knowledge, for example, what is AM contribution, and only calculates the maximum allowed income?

Our app will help all the international EU students to follow the rules about SU, and it will also be an educational app (how to read a payslip, how taxes work, etc...).
